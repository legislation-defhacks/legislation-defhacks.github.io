**Purpose**

This project is for defhacks at Seattle on March 24th - 25th. Our goal is to visualize  predictions for 
votes on bills in Congress. These predications are based on past voting patterns based on bill subjects
and party affiliations.

Some materials, tools, and people that we relied on were Bootstrap, d3, Mike Bostock, https://github.com/unitedstates/congress, http://scikit-learn.org.
